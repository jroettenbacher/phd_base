  abstract  = {Algorithms, based on Magnus's form equations, are described that minimize the difference between several relationships between temperature and water vapor pressure at saturation that are commonly used in archiving data. The work was initiated in connection with the development of a unified upper-air dataset that will use measurements gathered from the late 1930s to the present and archived in several data centers. The conversion of field measurements to archived humidity values within the databases that are being used have not been consistent and in some cases are unknown. A goal of this work was to develop a uniform and accurate method to convert these data to various humidity variables without regard to the equations used in archiving the original data. Archived temperature values are recorded to 0.1°C. This precision creates a temperature dependent range in uncertainty in saturation vapor pressure. A procedure was developed to take this into account when the error minimizing equations were derived.},

  abstract  = {It is necessary to calculate the saturation vapor pressure of water and of ice for some purposes in many disciplines. A number of formulas are available for this calculation. These formulas either are tedious or are not very accurate. In this study, a new formula has been developed by integrating the Clausius–Clapeyron equation. This new formula is simple and easy to remember. In comparison with the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam reference dataset, the mean relative errors from this new formula are only 0.001% and 0.006% for the saturation vapor pressure of water and of ice, respectively, within a wide range of temperatures from −100° to 100°C. In addition, this new formula yields a mean relative error of 0.0005% within the commonly occurring temperature range (10°–40°C). Therefore, this new formula has significant advantages over the improved Magnus formula and can be used to calculate the saturation vapor pressure of water and of ice in a wide variety of disciplines.},
