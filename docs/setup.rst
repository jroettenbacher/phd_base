Setup
======

For now (November 2021) the easiest way to use this is to ask Johannes to become collaborator on his git project and then either work within his repository or create a folder in the copied repository which you can track with your own git.
A possible structure could look like this::

   ├── phd_base  # source code managed by Johannes`s github account
   │   ├── analysis
   │   ├── docs
   │   ├── processing
   │   ├── pylim  # actual python module
   │   ├── quicklooks
   │   ├── your_folder  # source code managed by your git
   │   ├── config.toml
   │   ├── LICENSE
   │   ├── README.md
   │   ├── requirements.txt
