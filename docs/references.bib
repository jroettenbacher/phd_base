  abstract = {Calculated irradiances from a new radiation code are compared with in situ observations of short-wave irradiances from the UK Meteorological Office's C-130 aircraft. Three cases of clear skies are studied and four where a liquid-water boundary-layer cloud was present. Under clear-sky conditions the modelled and in situ observations agree to within 3\%, which is the estimated accuracy of the observations. In the cloudy-sky cases the albedo and transmittance agree to within {$\pm$}0.1 but the absorption in the model is higher than that observed, sometimes by a factor of two; there is no evidence of anomalous absorption in the observations. The observed absorptions do not exceed 6\% for the stratocumulus cases considered. The results clearly identify the problems of representing inhomogeneous clouds as plane parallel layers in radiation models. Analysis of the variability of the cloud microphysics provides some insight into the importance of regions of low optical depth within the clouds.},

  abstract = {A one-dimensional thermodynamic model of sea ice is presented that focuses on those features that are most relevant to interactions with the atmosphere, namely the surface albedo and leads. It includes a surface albedo parameterization that interacts strongly with the state of the surface, and explicitly includes meltwater ponds. The lead parameterization contains a minimum lead fraction, absorption of solar radiation in and below the leads, lateral accretion and ablation of the sea ice, and a prescribed sea ice divergence rate. The model performed well in predicting the current climatic sea ice conditions in the central Arctic when compared with observations and other theoretical calculations. Results of parameter sensitivity tests produced large equilibrium ice thicknesses for small values of ice divergence or large values of minimum lead fraction as a result of positive feedback mechanisms involving cooling of water in the leads. The ice thickness was also quite sensitive to the meltwater runoff fraction and moderately sensitive to the other parameters in the melt pond parameterization, a result of the strong dependence of the surface albedo, and hence the net flux, on the surface conditions. To further investigate the physical interactions and internal feedback processes governing the sea ice-lead system, sensitivity tests were also performed for each of the external forcing variables. The model's equilibrium sea ice thickness was extremely sensitive to changes in the downward longwave and shortwave fluxes and atmospheric temperature and humidity, moderately sensitive to the value of the ocean heat flux, and insensitive to values of wind speed, snowfall, and rainfall in the immediate vicinity of the baseline forcing, although significant changes in thickness occurred for larger variations in wind speed and snowfall. Four important positive feedback loops were identified and described: (1) the surface albedo feedback, (2) the conduction feedback, (3) the lead solar flux feedback, and (4) the lead fraction feedback. The destabilizing effects of these positive feedbacks were mitigated by two strong negative feedbacks: (1) the outgoing longwave flux feedback, and (2) the turbulent flux feedback. Considering the strong influence which sea ice has on global atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns, it is essential that climate models be able to treat these feedback processes appropriately.},

  abstract = {Algorithms, based on Magnus's form equations, are described that minimize the difference between several relationships between temperature and water vapor pressure at saturation that are commonly used in archiving data. The work was initiated in connection with the development of a unified upper-air dataset that will use measurements gathered from the late 1930s to the present and archived in several data centers. The conversion of field measurements to archived humidity values within the databases that are being used have not been consistent and in some cases are unknown. A goal of this work was to develop a uniform and accurate method to convert these data to various humidity variables without regard to the equations used in archiving the original data. Archived temperature values are recorded to 0.1{\textdegree}C. This precision creates a temperature dependent range in uncertainty in saturation vapor pressure. A procedure was developed to take this into account when the error minimizing equations were derived.},

  abstract = {A poor representation of cloud structure in a general circulation model (GCM) is widely recognised as a potential source of error in the radiation budget. Here, we develop a new way of representing both horizontal and vertical cloud structure in a radiation scheme. This combines the `Tripleclouds' parametrization, which introduces inhomogeneity by using two cloudy regions in each layer as opposed to one, each with different water content values, with `exponential-random' overlap, in which clouds in adjacent layers are not overlapped maximally, but according to a vertical decorrelation scale. This paper, Part I of two, aims to parametrize the two effects such that they can be used in a GCM. To achieve this, we first review a number of studies for a globally applicable value of fractional standard deviation of water content for use in Tripleclouds. We obtain a value of 0.75 {$\pm$} 0.18 from a variety of different types of observations, with no apparent dependence on cloud type or gridbox size. Then, through a second short review, we create a parametrization of decorrelation scale for use in exponential-random overlap, which varies the scale linearly with latitude from 2.9 km at the Equator to 0.4 km at the poles. When applied to radar data, both components are found to have radiative impacts capable of offsetting biases caused by cloud misrepresentation. Part II of this paper implements Tripleclouds and exponential-random overlap into a radiation code and examines both their individual and combined impacts on the global radiation budget using re-analysis data.},
