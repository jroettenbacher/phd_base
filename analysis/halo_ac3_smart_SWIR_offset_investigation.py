"""Investigate offset of SWIR spectrometer during |haloac3|

After the first final calibration for |haloac3| (September 2022) it was discovered that the SWIR spectrometer data consistently shows too low values compared to the VNIR spectrometer.
The VNIR spectrometer is closer to the libRadtran clearsky simulation and can thus be considered to be "true".
To investigate this offset RF14 is used as it was a flight with a lot of long straight legs.
One of which was heading far north and thus experiencing high solar zenith angles.


**Steps:**

- Checked all SWIR dark current |rarr| no change over flight (see ``.../quicklooks/SMART_SWIR_dark_current``)
- VNIR dark current comes from transfer calibration |rarr| looks good (see :numref:`dark-current`)
- Plot minutely averaged spectra |rarr| offset between spectrometers gets smaller with higher wavelengths (see ``.../case_studies/...RF14/spectra``)
- Check mean difference between VNIR and SWIR for different wavelengths (see :numref:`table`)
- Look at other flights and plot the spectra of those (RF17)
- look at difference between VNIR and SWIR for 985nm for all flights (see :numref:`diff-985-all`)

.. _dark-current:

.. figure:: figures/2022_04_07_09_08.Fdw_VNIR.dat_dark_current.png

    Dark current used for correction of VNIR measurements during RF14.


Dark current correction works as expected.
The dark current is also correctly written into the calibrated netCDF files.
The field calibration factor looks stable between 950 and 2100 nm for the SWIR spectrometer.
The VNIR field calibration factor shows a strong increase towards higher wavelengths.

    Field calibration factor for the VNIR and the SWIR spectrometer for RF14.
    Wavelength cutoffs at 400, 950 and 2100 nm.

Looking at minutely averaged spectra from both spectrometers shows that the offset between the two is less for higher wavelengths.
Thus, 975nm is tried as a cutoff between the two.
The difference between the two 975nm measurements is shown below.
It can be seen that the VNIR spectrometer is usually between 0.02 and 0.05 :math:`W\,m^{-2}\,nm^{-1}` higher than the SWIR spectrometer.

    Difference between VNIR and SWIR spectrometer for 975nm during RF14.
    Exact wavelengths differ slightly, 974.8nm and 972.8nm (VNIR, SWIR).

Looking at different wavelengths and calculating the mean difference yields the following results fro RF14.

      995           994.73             992.09             0.010

The mean difference between 985nm is lowest.
At this wavelength also the VNIR and SWIR wavelengths are close to each other, only 0.5nm difference.
However, at 960nm the difference is only 0.08nm but the difference in measurement is 0.028 :math:`W\,m^{-2}\,nm^{-1}`.

The analysis is repeated for each flight and the difference between the 985nm pixel from the two spectrometers is shown in :numref:`diff-985-all`.
The single txt files for all wavelengths for one flight can be found in the respective case study folders.
One csv file with all flights has been saved in the ``case_studies`` folder (``mean_diff_VNIR-SWIR.csv``).

.. _diff-985-all:

.. figure:: figures/HALO-AC3_mean_diff_VNIR-SWIR_985nm.png

    Mean difference between the 985nm measurement from the VNIR (985.18nm) and the SWIR (985.68nm) spectrometer for each research flight.


This plot is produced for each wavelength between 950 and 995nm.
They can be found in ``.../case_studies/spectrometer_overlap``.
Looking through those plots it becomes apparent that the 990nm wavelength shows the lowest difference between the two spectrometers on average.

.. _diff-990-all:

.. figure:: figures/HALO-AC3_mean_diff_VNIR-SWIR_990nm.png

    Mean difference between the 990nm measurement from the VNIR (989.98nm) and the SWIR (992.09nm) spectrometer for each research flight.

Due to this result the wavelength at which the two spectra are merged is set to **990** nm.
