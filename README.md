# PhD Base Project

*author: Johannes RÃ¶ttenbacher*

Here I code all the stuff I need for my PhD on Arctic cirrus. 
It includes processing for measurement data gathered by the HALO aircraft.
During the first year a new python package was created which provides useful functions used in the processing and analysis of the data.
The package is called `pylim` and can be found in `src`.
Further there are folders for different purposes:

* `analysis`: case studies or general campaign analysis to answer scientific questions
* `processing`: scripts to generate error/bias corrected, calibrated and shareable/publishable files from raw files
* `quicklooks`: quicklooks of measurements (raw and calibrated) and of calibrations

The data is sorted by flight.
The exact paths are defined in `config.toml` and can be adjusted according to your setup.
More information on how to adjust this file can be found in [Setup](./docs/setup.rst).

Documentation can be found [here](https://jroettenbacher.github.io/phd_base/).


## FAQ

* What do negative measurements in the SMART dark current mean?

Answer: The conversion of the analog signal to a digital can lead to this.
